Open your terminal and run the following command:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathamesh901/Udyog-AI.git
cd Udyog-AI
```

This will download the repository and navigate you to the project folder.  

### **Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:  

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Next.js, Prisma, Clerk, Stripe, Pusher, and other necessary packages.  

### **Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:  

```env
# Database Configuration  
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# Clerk Authentication  
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your_clerk_secret_key"

# Uploadcare Storage  
UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY="your_uploadcare_key"

# Stripe Payment Processing  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"

# Pusher for Real-Time Updates  
PUSHER_APP_ID="your_pusher_app_id"
PUSHER_KEY="your_pusher_key"
PUSHER_SECRET="your_pusher_secret"
PUSHER_CLUSTER="your_pusher_cluster"
```

### **Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Prisma Client**  
Run the following command to generate the Prisma client:  

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### **Troubleshooting**  
- If the database connection fails, double-check the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`.  
- If Prisma does not work, try running `npx prisma generate` again.  
- If authentication issues occur, verify that Clerk keys are correctly configured.
